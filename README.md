Dtella
========================================

A distributed P2P system which emulates a Direct Connect hub, primarily for college 
campuses and other low-latency LANs, for more information see [http://dtella.org](http://dtella.org).


About this Repository
----------------------------------------

This repository was created as a fork of the [latest revision (r635)](https://code.google.com/p/dtella/source/detail?r=635)
of Dtella from the official SVN repository. The intent of this fork is to improve upon
the original Dtella implementation and investigate ways that it could be improved further.


Project Goals
----------------------------------------

* To find an alternative to the dependency on a centralized DNS TXT or external Google doc and
  investigate making it truly redundant and de-centralized.
* Improve the creation of insallers and create one-click installers that makes it easy to
  use Dtella with an already pre-configured client for Windows, OS X, and Linux.
* Investigate improving the mesh network and DHT implementation.
